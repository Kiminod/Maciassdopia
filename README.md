This is our new project named Maciassdopia >:)

## In first case you need to run right file
Windows:

```setup.ps1```

Linux:

```chmod +x ./setup.sh```

```sudo ./setup.sh```

## Initializing project (windows)
I recommend using python virtual enviromend. You can create your own by running command:

```py -3 -m venv .venv```

Then you need to active your venv:

```.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```

After that type (for installing all dependencies):

```py -m pip install -r requrements.txt```

Now project is ready for the build.

## Initializing project (linux)
I recommend using python virtual enviromend. You can create your own by running command:

```python3 -m venv .venv```

If there is an error with missing venv run:

```sudo apt install python3-venv```

Then you need to active your venv:

```source .venv/bin/activate```

After that type (for installing all dependencies):

```python -m pip install -r requrements.txt```

Now project is ready for the build.

## Building project
If u want to build the project, just type:

```py .\builder.py```

Or for linux:

```sudo python ./builder.py```
