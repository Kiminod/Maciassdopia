## Initializing project (windows)
I recommend using python virtual enviromend. You can create your own by running command:
```py -3 -m venv .venv```
Then you need to active your venv (in powershell like in vs code terminal):
```.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```
After that type (for installing all dependencies):
```py -m pip install -r requrements.txt```
Now project is ready for the build.

## Building project
If u want to build the project, just type:
```py .\builder.py```

This is our new project named Maciassdopia >:)
